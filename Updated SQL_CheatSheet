#### **SQL Keywords**

Here you can find a collection of keywords used in SQL statements, a description, and where appropriate an example. Some of the more advanced keywords have their own dedicated section.

Where MySQL is mentioned next to an example, this means this example is only applicable to MySQL databases (as opposed to any other database system).


```
ADD -- Adds a new column to an existing table

ADD CONSTRAINT -- Creates a new constraint on an existing table, which is used to specify rules for any data in the table.

ALTER TABLE -- Adds, deletes or edits columns in a table. It can also be used to add and delete constraints in a table, as per the above.

ALTER COLUMN -- Changes the data type of a table's column.

ALL -- Returns true if all of the subquery values meet the passed condition.

AND -- Used to join separate conditions within a WHERE clause.

ANY -- Returns true if any of the subquery values meet the given condition.

AS -- Renames a table or column with an alias value which only exists for the duration of the query.

ASC -- Used with ORDER BY to return the data in ascending order.

BETWEEN -- Selects values within the given range.

CASE -- Changes query output depending on conditions.

CHECK -- Adds a constraint that limits the value which can be added to a column.

CREATE DATABASE -- Creates a new database.

CREATE TABLE -- Creates a new table. 

DEFAULT -- Sets a default value for a column

DELETE -- Delete data from a table.

DESC -- Used with ORDER BY to return the data in descending order.

DROP COLUMN -- Deletes a column from a table.

DROP DATABASE -- Deletes the entire database.

DROP DEAFULT -- Removes a default value for a column.

DROP TABLE -- Deletes a table from a database.

EXISTS -- Checks for the existence of any record within the subquery, returning true if one or more records are returned.

FROM -- Specifies which table to select or delete data from.

IN --  Used alongside a WHERE clause as a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

INSERT INTO -- Adds new rows to a table.

IS NULL -- Tests for empty (NULL) values.

IS NOT NULL -- The reverse of NULL. Tests for values that aren't empty / NULL.

LIKE -- Returns true if the operand value matches a pattern.

NOT -- Returns true if a record DOESN'T meet the condition.


OR -- Used alongside WHERE to include data when either condition is true.

ORDER BY -- Used to sort the result data in ascending (default) or descending order through the use of ASC or DESC keywords.

ROWNUM -- Returns results where the row number meets the passed condition.

SELECT -- Used to select data from a database, which is then returned in a results set.

SELECT DISTINCT -- Sames as SELECT, except duplicate values are excluded.

SELECT INTO -- Copies data from one table and inserts it into another.

SELECT TOP -- Allows you to return a set number of records to return from a table.

SET -- Used alongside UPDATE to update existing data in a table.

SOME -- Identical to ANY.

TOP -- Used alongside SELECT to return a set number of records from a table.

TRUNCATE TABLE -- Similar to DROP, but instead of deleting the table and its data, this deletes only the data.

UNION -- Combines the results from 2 or more SELECT statements and returns only distinct values.

UNION ALL -- The same as UNION, but includes duplicate values.

UNIQUE -- This constraint ensures all values in a column are unique.

UPDATE -- Updates existing data in a table.

VALUES -- Used alongside the INSERT INTO keyword to add new values to a table.

WHERE -- Filters results to only include data which meets the given condition.
```



#### **Comments in SQL**

Comments allow you to explain sections of your SQL statements, without being executed directly.

In SQL, there are 2 types of comments, single line and multiline.


##### **Single Line Comments in SQL**

Single line comments start with ‘- -’. Any text after these 2 characters to the end of the line will be ignored.


```
-- This part is ignored

SELECT * FROM customers;
```



##### **Multiline Comments in SQL**

Multiline comments start with /* and end with */. They stretch across multiple lines until the closing characters have been found.


```
/*

This is a multiline comment.
It can span across multiple lines.

*/

SELECT * FROM customers;

/*

This is another comment. 
You can even put code within a comment to prevent its execution

SELECT * FROM icecreams;

*/
```



#### **Data Types in MySQL**

When creating a new table or editing an existing one, you must specify the type of data that each column accepts.

Example data passed to the `id` column must be an int (integer), while the `FirstName` column has a `VARCHAR` data type with a maximum of 255 characters.


```
CREATE TABLE customers(
id int,
FirstName varchar(255)
);
```



##### **1. String Data Types**


```
CHAR(size) -- Fixed length string which can contain letters, numbers and special characters. The size parameter sets the maximum string length, from 0 – 255 with a default of 1.

VARCHAR(size) -- Variable length string similar to CHAR(), but with a maximum string length range from 0 to 65535.

BINARY(size) -- Similar to CHAR() but stores binary byte strings.

VARBINARY(size) -- Similar to VARCHAR() but for binary byte strings.

TINYBLOB -- Holds Binary Large Objects (BLOBs) with a max length of 255 bytes.

TINYTEXT -- Holds a string with a maximum length of 255 characters. Use VARCHAR() instead, as it's fetched much faster.

TEXT(size) -- Holds a string with a maximum length of 65535 bytes. Again, better to use VARCHAR().

BLOB(size) -- Holds Binary Large Objects (BLOBs) with a max length of 65535 bytes.

MEDIUMTEXT -- Holds a string with a maximum length of 16,777,215 characters.

MEDIUMBLOB -- Holds Binary Large Objects (BLOBs) with a max length of 16,777,215 bytes.

LONGTEXT -- Holds a string with a maximum length of 4,294,967,295 characters.

LONGBLOB -- Holds Binary Large Objects (BLOBs) with a max length of 4,294,967,295 bytes.

ENUM(a, b, c, etc…) -- A string object that only has one value, which is chosen from a list of values which you define, up to a maximum of 65535 values. If a value is added which isn't on this list, it's replaced with a blank value instead.

SET(a, b, c, etc…) -- A string object that can have 0 or more values, which is chosen from a list of values which you define, up to a maximum of 64 values.
```



##### **2. Numeric Data Types**


```
BIT(size) -- A bit-value type with a default of 1. The allowed number of bits in a value is set via the size parameter, which can hold values from 1 to 64.

TINYINT(size) -- A very small integer with a signed range of -128 to 127, and an unsigned range of 0 to 255. Here, the size parameter specifies the maximum allowed display width, which is 255.

BOOL -- Essentially a quick way of setting the column to TINYINT with a size of 1. 0 is considered false, whilst 1 is considered true.

BOOLEAN	-- Same as BOOL.

SMALLINT(size) -- A small integer with a signed range of -32768 to 32767, and an unsigned range from 0 to 65535. Here, the size parameter specifies the maximum allowed display width, which is 255.

MEDIUMINT(size) -- A medium integer with a signed range of -8388608 to 8388607, and an unsigned range from 0 to 16777215. Here, the size parameter specifies the maximum allowed display width, which is 255.

INT(size) -- A medium integer with a signed range of -2147483648 to 2147483647, and an unsigned range from 0 to 4294967295. Here, the size parameter specifies the maximum allowed display width, which is 255.

INTEGER(size) -- Same as INT.

BIGINT(size) -- A medium integer with a signed range of -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807, and an unsigned range from 0 to 18446744073709551615. Here, the size parameter specifies the maximum allowed display width, which is 255.

FLOAT(p) -- A floating point number value. If the precision (p) parameter is between 0 to 24, then the data type is set to FLOAT(), whilst if it's from 25 to 53, the data type is set to DOUBLE(). This behaviour is to make the storage of values more efficient.

DOUBLE(size, d) -- A floating point number value where the total digits are set by the size parameter, and the number of digits after the decimal point is set by the d parameter.

DECIMAL(size, d) -- An exact fixed point number where the total number of digits is set by the size parameters, and the total number of digits after the decimal point is set by the d parameter.

DEC(size, d) -- Same as DECIMAL.
```



##### **3. Date/Time Data Types**


```
DATE -- A simple date in YYYY-MM–DD format, with a supported range from '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'.

DATETIME(fsp) -- A date time in YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss format, with a supported range from '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'. By adding DEFAULT and ON UPDATE to the column definition, it automatically sets to the current date/time.

TIMESTAMP(fsp) -- A Unix Timestamp, which is a value relative to the number of seconds since the Unix epoch ('1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC). This has a supported range from '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-09 03:14:07' UTC.
By adding DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and ON UPDATE CURRENT TIMESTAMP to the column definition, it automatically sets to current date/time.

TIME(fsp) -- A time in hh:mm:ss format, with a supported range from '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'.

YEAR -- A year, with a supported range of '1901' to '2155'.

```



#### **Wildcard Characters in SQL**

In SQL, Wildcards are special characters used with the `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` keywords. This allows us to search for data with sophisticated patterns rather efficiently.


```
% -- Equates to zero or more characters.
-- Example: Find all customers with surnames ending in 'ory'.
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE surname LIKE '%ory';

_ -- Equates to any single character.
-- Example: Find all customers living in cities beginning with any 3 characters, followed by 'vale'.
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE city LIKE '_ _ _vale';

[charlist] -- Equates to any single character in the list.
-- Example: Find all customers with first names beginning with J, K or T.
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE first_name LIKE '[jkt]%';
```



#### **SQL Keys**

In relational databases, there is a concept of _primary _and _foreign _keys. In SQL tables, these are included as constraints, where a table can have a primary key, a foreign key, or both.


##### **1. Primary Keys in SQL**

A primary lets each record in a table be uniquely identified. You can only have one primary key per table, and you can assign this constraint to any single or combination of columns. However, this means each value within this column(s) needs to be unique.

Typically in a table, the ID column is a primary key, and is usually paired with the `AUTO_INCREMENT` keyword. This means the value increases automatically as and when new records are created.


##### **Example (MySQL)**

Create a new table and set the primary key to the ID column.


```
CREATE TABLE customers (
id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
FirstName varchar(255),
Last Name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
address varchar(255),
email varchar(255),
PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```



##### **2. Foreign Keys in SQL**

You can apply a foreign key to one column or many. You use it to _link _2 tables together in a relational database.

The table containing the foreign key is called the _child _key,

The table containing the referenced (or candidate) key is called the _parent _table.

This essentially means that the column data is shared between 2 tables, because a foreign key also prevents invalid data from being inserted which isn’t also present in the parent table.


##### **Example (MySQL)**

Create a new table and turn any column that references IDs in other tables into foreign keys.


```
CREATE TABLE orders (
id int NOT NULL,
user_id int,
product_id int,
PRIMARY KEY (id),
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id)
);
```



#### **Indexes in SQL**

Indexes are attributes that can be assigned to columns that are frequently searched against to make data retrieval a quicker and more efficient process.


```
CREATE INDEX -- Creates an index named 'idx_test' on the first_name and surname columns of the users table. In this instance, duplicate values are allowed.
CREATE INDEX idx_test
ON users (first_name, surname);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX -- The same as the above, but no duplicate values.
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_test
ON users (first_name, surname);
DROP INDEX -- Removes an index.
ALTER TABLE users
DROP INDEX idx_test;
```



#### **SQL Joins**

In SQL, a `JOIN` clause is used to return a result which combines data from multiple tables, based on a common column which is featured in both of them.

There are a number of different joins available for you to use:



* **Inner Join (Default): **Returns any records which have matching values in both tables.
* **Left Join:** Returns all of the records from the first table, along with any matching records from the second table.
* **Right Join:** Returns all of the records from the second table, along with any matching records from the first.
* **Full Join:** Returns all records from both tables when there is a match.

A common way of visualizing how joins work is like this:


```
SELECT orders.id, users.FirstName, users.Surname, products.name as 'product name'
FROM orders
INNER JOIN users on orders.user_id = users.id
INNER JOIN products on orders.product_id = products.id;
```



#### **Views in SQL**

A view is essentially an SQL results set that gets stored in the database under a label, so you can return to it later without having to rerun the query.

These are especially useful when you have a costly SQL query which you might need a number of times. So instead of running it over and over to generate the same results set, you can just do it once and save it as a view.


##### **How to Create Views in SQL**

To create a view, you can do so like this:


```
CREATE VIEW priority_users AS
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE country = 'United Kingdom';
```


Then in future, if you need to access the stored result set, you can do so like this:


```
SELECT * FROM [priority_users];
```



##### **How to Replace Views in SQL**

With the `CREATE OR REPLACE` command, you can update a view like this:


```
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [priority_users] AS
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE country = 'United Kingdom' OR country='USA';
```



##### **How to Delete Views in SQL**

To delete a view, simply use the `DROP VIEW` command.


```
DROP VIEW priority_users;
